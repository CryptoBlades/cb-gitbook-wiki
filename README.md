# CryptoBlades

CryptoBlades is a Play to Earn NFT RPG developed by Riveted Games on the Binance Smart Chain platform. The game revolves around the acquisition of legendary Blades and powerful Heroes to wield them. Players may participate in combat using their assets to earn SKILL tokens. Assets are player owned NFTs minted in the ERC-721 standard which may be traded on the proprietary marketplace.

## Vision

Our vision is for gamers to regain control of their digital assets, Play to Earn, and increase adoption of blockchain technology in their everyday lives.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a fun and profitable experience for our players, to create a healthy and excited community around blockchain gaming, and build an ecosystem of Play-To-Earn systems to meet the needs of all gamers from around the world.

## Play to Earn

CryptoBlades utilizes a Play-to-Earn model by distributing SKILL through gameplay, and giving value to player NFTs by increasing their use through future features.

NFTs may be freely traded on the marketplace for SKILL tokens, which can then be traded on exchanges or converted to fiat currency.

Currently the following options are available for the player to earn:

* Participating in combat through the use of character and weapon NFTs for SKILL.
* Minting characters and weapons and selling them for SKILL on the marketplace.
* Trading NFTs with other players for BEP-20 tokens.
* Exchanging SKILL on a DEX for currency that can be traded on an exchange such as Binance.
