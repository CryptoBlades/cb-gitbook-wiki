# Getting Started

The requirements to start playing CryptoBlades are a Binance Smart Chain compatible wallet such as MetaMask, and BNB to be used for purchasing SKILL and to pay for gas fees.

MetaMask can be installed as a browser extension, or as an application on your mobile devices.

The instructions to install MetaMask can be found here:
