# Gas Fees

CryptoBlades operates purely on-chain, and due to this there is a necessity for gas fees to be constantly paid by the players using BNB.

Gas fees are necessary to conduct operations on the Binance Smart Chain, and operating on-chain through the use of [Chainlink's VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/) technology ensures that all entropy-based gameplay scenarios such as minting NFTs or combat will always be provably fair.

Players are always required to hold an amount of BNB in your MetaMask wallet to ensure the capability of conducting transactions and interacting with the CryptoBlades smart contracts.

The gas fees usually cost around 0.0007 to 0.0010 BNB depending on the transaction, however certain transactions such as claiming experience can be higher depending on the numerical data involved.

Combat gas fees are listed at 0.0025, however that is just a maximum amount that the player may pay. The true gas costs of fights are around 0.0007 BNB which can be seen in your MetaMask transactions.
