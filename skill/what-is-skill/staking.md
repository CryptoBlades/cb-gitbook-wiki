# Staking

## $XWeapon for $XWeapon

The $XWeapon for $XWeapon staking pool rewards $XWeapon in return for staking any $XWeapon from the player's wallet or from any unclaimed in the rewards pool.

$XWeapon that gets staked in this pool gets locked for seven days, though additional deposits after the initial deposit does not "refresh" the seven day lock period.

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that users can stake a small amount of $XWeapon to start the lock timer, and continue to top up the staked balance without extending the lock timer.
{% endhint %}

Unclaimed $XWeapon may be directly staked into this pool. Please note that staking unclaimed $XWeapon will refresh the user's Early Withdraw Tax.

After seven days, users may withdraw their staked $XWeapon directly into their MetaMask wallets with zero tax.

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that users may avoid the 15% tax altogether, if they stake their unclaimed $XWeaponand wait for the seven day lock period before withdrawing it all out with no tax.
{% endhint %}

The lock timer of staking only resets when the player withdraws any amount. This means that players may continue to top up their staking pool after the seven day timer is up, and it will not lock them out of withdrawing their staked $XWeapon.
