# Staking

## SKILL for SKILL

The SKILL for SKILL staking pool rewards SKILL in return for staking any SKILL from the player's wallet or from any unclaimed in the rewards pool.

SKILL that gets staked in this pool gets locked for seven days, though additional deposits after the initial deposit does not "refresh" the seven day lock period.

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that users can stake a small amount of SKILL to start the lock timer, and continue to top up the staked balance without extending the lock timer.
{% endhint %}

Unclaimed SKILL may be directly staked into this pool and the user receives an immediate 10% bonus In-Game-Only SKILL that can be used for minting characters, forging weapons, and reforging. Please note that staking unclaimed SKILL will refresh the user's Early Withdraw Tax.

After seven days, users may withdraw their staked SKILL directly into their MetaMask wallets with 0 tax.

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that users may avoid the 15% tax altogether, if they stake their unclaimed SKILL and wait for the seven day lock period before withdrawing it all out with no tax.
{% endhint %}

The lock timer of staking only resets when the player withdraws any amount. This means that players may continue to top up their staking pool after the seven day timer is up, and it will not lock them out of withdrawing their staked SKILL.
