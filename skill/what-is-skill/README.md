# What is $XWeapon?

$XWeapon serves as the native currency for CryptoWar. Players leverage $XWeapon to acquire characters, forge and reforge weapons, and to buy and sell on the CryptoWar marketplace.

There is a maximum supply of 1,000,000 $XWeapon tokens.

The supply of SKILL is designated as follows:

* IDO - 35%
* Gameplay Incentives - 20%
* Development - 20%
* Initial Liquidity - 15%
* Liquidity Incentives - 10%

The development fund vests at a rate of 25% per quarter. The Investor fund vests at a rate of 25% per month.

## Game Health

The most important part of CryptoWar is the game contract and maintaining enough $XWeapon to always be able to pay out players when necessary.

The main mechanism of tokenomic control is the oracle, which informs the game contract about the current dollar value of SKILL and is used to stabilize the different game functions such as minting NFTs and fight payouts to maintain a stable dollar value.

More information on the oracle can be found in the following page:

## $XWeapon Sinks and Faucets

The flow of $XWeapon in and out of the contract is controlled by the faucets and sinks present in the game.

A faucet is an activity that distributes $XWeapon to players and a sink is any activity that consumes $XWeapon. Due to the limited supply of $XWeapon, a balance between the two is vital to game health.

Faucets in CryptoWar distributes $XWeapon  to players, and the rewards pool that the faucets use is replenished by any sinks in the game.

The current faucets in the game are as follows:

* Combat

The current sinks in the game are as follows:

* Recruit Character
* Forge Weapon
* Reforge Weapon
* Marketplace Tax
* Early Withdrawal Tax

Future gameplay features will determine the balance of faucets and sinks which will be carefully managed by the developers. In-game events can act as "tokenomic levers" to drive the flow of tokens in and out of the contract.

An example of in-game events would be a "Reforge Bonus" event where an increase in average $XWeapon spending is expected to be seen and will replenish the $XWeapon in the contract.

## Impact of Multi-Accounting

Many questions come up around the subject of multi-accounting and sustainability. This is not an issue because the economics of the game cannot distinguish between a single player who has 10 accounts, compared to 10 players each with a single account.

Compared to a free-to-play model, $XWeapon needs to be spent in order to earn $XWeapon. Actions are time gated by stamina, so earnings are proportional to investment and having multiple accounts does not give any unfair advantage. Bots are prohibited, so a single user must still manage all of their accounts.

Players are free to reinvest into the game to increase their earning potential as stated by the developers.
