# Spending $XWeapon

$XWeapon is the currency used to create and enhance the asset NFTs players use to play the game. Over time, more use cases will be created to increase the value of $XWeapon and circulate the economy of the game.

## In Game Only Funds

In-Game-Only $XWeapon is $XWeapon that can only be spent on minting weapons, and reforging.

In-Game-Only cannot be spent on the marketplace to purchase NFTs.

This $XWeapon is currently unobtainable at the moment, though this maybe subject to change depending on future features.

## $XWeapon Spending Order

CryptoWar will prioritize spending $XWeapon in the following order for minting characters, weapons, and reforging:

1. In-Game-Only
2. Unclaimed $XWeapon
3. Wallet $XWeapon

If one pool of $XWeapon is insufficient for the transaction, CryptoWar will take $XWeapon from the next pool in the list above to satisfy the cost.

## Minting Characters

Characters are one of the two main NFTs currently available in CryptoWar. Characters are necessary to perform combat in CryptoWar and only increase in value as the player continues to win fights.

All of the $XWeapon spent minting characters goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.

## Minting Weapons

Weapons are one of the two main NFTs currently available in CryptoWar. Weapons are used by characters to perform fights and earn $XWeapon.

Minting weapons currently serves as the primary $XWeapon sink along with reforging.

All of the $XWeapon spent minting weapons goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.

## Reforging Weapons

Players can spend $XWeapon to burn one weapon into another, increasing it's stats and value. Reforging can be used when the player has an excess of weapons due to mass forging, and gives value to low rarity weapons that other players might not want to purchase.

All of the $XWeapon spent reforging weapons goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.
