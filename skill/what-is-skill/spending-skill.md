# Spending SKILL

SKILL is the currency used to create and enhance the asset NFTs players use to play the game. Over time, more use cases will be created to increase the value of SKILL and circulate the economy of the game.

## In Game Only Funds

In-Game-Only SKILL is SKILL that can only be spent on minting characters, minting weapons, and reforging.

In-Game-Only cannot be spent on the marketplace to purchase NFTs.

This SKILL is currently obtainable through staking in the SKILL for SKILL pool.

More information on staking can be found here:

## SKILL Spending Order

CryptoBlades will prioritize spending SKILL in the following order for minting characters, weapons, and reforging:

1. In-Game-Only
2. Unclaimed SKILL
3. Wallet SKILL

If one pool of SKILL is insufficient for the transaction, CryptoBlades will take SKILL from the next pool in the list above to satisfy the cost.

## Minting Characters

Characters are one of the two main NFTs currently available in CryptoBlades. Characters are necessary to perform combat in CryptoBlades and only increase in value as the player continues to win fights.

All of the SKILL spent minting characters goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.

More information on characters can be found here:

## Minting Weapons

Weapons are one of the two main NFTs currently available in CryptoBlades. Weapons are used by characters to perform fights and earn SKILL.

Minting weapons currently serves as the primary SKILL sink along with reforging.

All of the SKILL spent minting weapons goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.

## Reforging Weapons

Players can spend SKILL to burn one weapon into another, increasing it's stats and value. Reforging can be used when the player has an excess of weapons due to mass forging, and gives value to low rarity weapons that other players might not want to purchase.

All of the SKILL spent reforging weapons goes directly into the contract used to give fight payouts.
